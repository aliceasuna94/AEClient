# AEClient

ARClient is a permaweb that is used to send and receive email through the Arweave network. By using an email client, you will be easier to manage email. ARClient was built based on the Arweave Blockchain and was developed by Aliceasua94 from an existing permaweb, Weavemail.

# How was it built?
ARClient uses the Arweave HTTP API, Arweave JS dan, and is published with Arweave Deploy.

You can launch a copy by installing Arweave Deploy and running arweave deploy index.html --key-file [PATH_TO_KEY] --package. After the transaction is mined into a block, you will be able to access it at the given TXID, at the Arweave HTTPS gateway.
