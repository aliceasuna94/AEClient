# AEClient

ARClient is a permaweb that is used to send and receive email through the Arweave network. By using an email client, you will be easier to manage email. ARClient was built based on the Arweave Blockchain and was developed by Aliceasua94 from an existing permaweb, Weavemail.

You can see Weavemail on https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/weavemail

# How was it built?
ARClient uses the Arweave HTTP API, Arweave JS dan, and is published with Arweave Deploy.

You can launch a copy by installing Arweave Deploy and running arweave deploy index.html --key-file [PATH_TO_KEY] --package. After the transaction is mined into a block, you will be able to access it at the given TXID, at the Arweave HTTPS gateway.

# Improved Features

AEClient was built with the aim of enhancing the user experience, having an intuitive display, both in additional features and in the inbox. This is the advantage of AEClient that can help you work more effectively. Remember, AEClient does not support other email provider services such as GMAIL, YAHOO, or HOTMAIL. AEClient only works for Weavemail.

1. Improved UI / UX appearance that is better and responsive. You can use this AEClient on Mobile and Desktop devices.
2. Improved the appearance of the Inbox. We changed the appearance by adding user icons, titles, content, and time. In addition, you can display email content by clicking on the email you want. Then a popup message display will appear.
